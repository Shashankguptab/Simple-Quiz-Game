# Simple-Quiz-Game
To develop a console-based quiz game in Python that asks users a set of questions, evaluates their answers,  and displays their score along with feedback.

Objectives:
1. To practice basic Python programming concepts such as variables, loops, conditionals, and functions.
2. To create a set of predefined questions and answers stored in an efficient data structure (like a dictionary or list).
3. To take user input, process it, and compare it with the correct answer.
4. To maintain and display a score based on correct responses.
5. To provide feedback to the user based on their performance.

The Simple Quiz Game is a console-based Python application designed to test a user’s knowledge through a series of predefined questions. The game asks each question one by one, takes the user’s input as an answer, and checks whether it is correct. A score is maintained throughout the game, and final results are displayed at the end with a performance message. This project is ideal for beginners learning Python basics such as variables, loops, conditionals, string handling, and dictionaries.

Key Features:
1. Asks a set of multiple questions.
2. Accepts user answers via the console.
3. Compares answers with correct responses.
4. Keeps track of the score.
5. Displays final results with feedback.

Technologies Used:
Language: Python 3
Modules: Built-in Python functions (no external libraries required)
